RGBLed - RGB Led Library for Arduino - jormc.es (2014)

A very basic RGB Led command library for Arduino. With this library 
you can command a common anode or common cathode RGB Led, and turn it in a great number of colors. 

I hope you enjoy it!

Any questions, modifications or corrections, please, contact me :-)
